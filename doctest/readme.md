# Functions to Perform Arithmetic Calculations

The `maq.py` Python module provides basic arithmetic
operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here are a few examples of how to use the functions in `maq.py`:

```python
>>> import maq

>>> maq.add(2, 2)
4.0

>>> maq.subtract(2, 2)
0.0

>>> maq.multiply(2, 2)
4.0

>>> maq.divide(2, 2)
1.0

```

These examples show how to use the `maq.py` module in your code.
